How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I start thinking about the product and start with review software needs. This project has helped me understand the design aspect of software. Seeing what i want the program to display and seeing that result come to life. This has actually taught me to keep running the program and experiment with other ways to see if you like things better. However always keep running it to find errors and unwanted behaviors after a change or two instead of fifty.


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I approach software development through reading documents carefully and multiple times to ensure i am doing what is asked of me. Iteration helps with the planning process and with the development process. by rereading the information and by running a program at all moments of changes helps keep the code neat and clearer. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science is allowing me to advance my career and my knowledge. I am a big learner and i love learning new things, so this has helped be learn something new (creating 3d objects). This is also allowing me to be one step closer to my goal of being in a tech focused career. I want to grow professionally and i want to be able to help with tech as it evolves since it is everchanging (and again back to that big learner status!).
